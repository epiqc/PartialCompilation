long_description="""<a href="https://qiskit.org/aqua" rel=nofollow>Qiskit Aqua</a> is an extensible,
 modular, open-source library of quantum computing algorithms.
 Researchers can experiment with Aqua algorithms, on near-term quantum devices and simulators,
 and can also get involved by contributing new algorithms and algorithm-supporting objects,
 such as optimizers and variational forms. Qiskit Aqua is used by Qiskit Aqua Chemistry,
 Qiskit Aqua Artificial Intelligence, and Qiskit Aqua Optimization to experiment with real-world applications to quantum computing."""
