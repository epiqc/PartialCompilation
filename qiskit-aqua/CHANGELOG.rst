`UNRELEASED`_
=============

`0.4.1`_ - 2019-01-09
=====================

Added
-----

- Optimizers now have most relevant options on constructor for ease of programming. Options may still be set via set_options.
- Provider is now explicilty named and the named backend is created from that named provider. Backend being selected from the first of the internally known set of providers is deprecated.
- Improve operation with Aer provider/backends.
- Registration to Aqua of externally provided pluggable algorithms and components altered to setuptools entry point support for plugins. The prior registration mechanism has been removed.
- A flag ``before_04`` in the ``load_from_dict(file)`` method is added to support to load operator in the old format. We encourage to save the operator in the new format from now on.

`0.4.0`_ - 2018-12-19
=====================

Added
-----

- Compatibility with Terra 0.7
- Compatibility with Aer 0.1
- Programmatic APIs for algorithms and components -- each component can now be instantiated and initialized via a single (non-emptY) constructot call
- ``QuantumInstance`` API for algorithm/backend decoupling -- ``QuantumInstance`` encapsulates a backend and its settings
- Updated documentation and Jupyter Notebooks illustrating the new programmatic APIs
- Transparent parallelization for gradient-based optimizers
- Multiple-Controlled-NOT (cnx) operation
- Pluggable algorithmic component ``RandomDistribution``
- Concrete implementations of ``RandomDistribution``: ``BernoulliDistribution``, ``LogNormalDistribution``, 
  ``MultivariateDistribution``, ``MultivariateNormalDistribution``, ``MultivariateUniformDistribution``, ``NormalDistribution``,
  ``UniformDistribution``, and ``UnivariateDistribution``
- Pluggable algorithmic component:
- Concrete implementations of ``UncertaintyProblem``: ``FixedIncomeExpectedValue``, ``EuropeanCallExpectedValue``, and 
  ``EuropeanCallDelta``
- Amplitude Estimation algorithm
- Qiskit Optimization: New Ising models for optimization problems exact cover, set packing, vertex cover, clique, and graph partition
- Qiskit AI:
   - New feature maps extending the ``FeatureMap`` pluggable interface: ``PauliExpansion`` and ``PauliZExpansion``
   - Training model serialization/deserialization mechanism
- Qiskit Finance:
   - Amplitude estimation for Bernoulli random variable: illustration of amplitude estimation on a single qubit problem
   - Loading of multiple univariate and multivariate random distributions
   - European call option: expected value and delta (using univariate distributions)
   - Fixed income asset pricing: expected value (using multivariate distributions)

Changed
-------

- The pauli string in ``Operator`` class is aligned with Terra 0.7. Now the order of a n-qubit pauli string is ``q_{n-1}...q{0}`` Thus, the (de)serialier (``save_to_dict`` and ``load_from_dict``) in the ``Operator`` class are also changed to adopt the changes of ``Pauli`` class.

Removed
-------

- ``HartreeFock`` component of pluggable type ``InitialState` moved to Qiskit Chemistry
- ``UCCSD`` component of pluggable type ``VariationalForm`` moved to Qiskit Chemistry
